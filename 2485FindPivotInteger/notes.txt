Problem:
Given a positive integer n, find the pivot integer x such that:
The sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively.
Return the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, return -1.
It is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot index for the given input.
**
Solution:
Make an array of prefix sums and remember the total sum.
Iterate through the array of elements and check whether the sum on the left side of the element equals total sum - current prefix sum.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
