Problem:
You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.
You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.

Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.
Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.
**
Solution:
Count the number of zeroes and the total length of the initial string.
Start with number one and prefix it with zero that amount of times zeroes are found in the initial string.
This string then, prefix with one that number of times number of one is found in the initial string - 1.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
