Problem:
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by
continuously following the next pointer.
Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to.
Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
**
Solution:
Iterate through list with two pointers. The iteration speed of the first pointer is regular,
and the iteration speed of the second is twice as fast. If the pointers will ever show on the same element,
that means there is a cycle in the list.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(1) Space
