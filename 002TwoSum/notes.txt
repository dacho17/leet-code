Problem:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
**
Solution:
For each number, use a dictionary to store a complement summand as the key and an index of a current number (first summand) as the value.
If the number checked exists in the dictionary, that means that the complementary summand has already been found on the index stored as a value.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
