Problem:
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
**
Solution:
In first traversal of the array create the new array containing squares of the numbers.
Quicksort the squares of the numbers.
**
Complexity:
O(nlogn) Time
O(n) Space
