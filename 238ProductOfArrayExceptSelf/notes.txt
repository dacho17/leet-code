Problem:
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal 
to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
**
Solution:
Iterate through the array from left to right to calculate and store left prefix products.
Iterate through the array from right to left to calculate and store right prefix products.
Upon second iteration multiply the left and right prefix products.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
