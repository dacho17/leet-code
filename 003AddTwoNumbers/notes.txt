Problem:
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
**
Solution:
Traverse through lists while at least one has elements in it.
Add the values found in the nodes. If the sum is greater than 10, forward 1 to the next sum.
(Numbers are given as lists of digits)
**
Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
