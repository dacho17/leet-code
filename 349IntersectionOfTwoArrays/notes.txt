Problem:
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection.
Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.
**
Solution:
Create a set of elements from the first array.
Iterate through the second array and add element to a solution set if the element can
be found in the set of first array elements.
**
Complexity:
O(n+m) Time
O(n) Space
