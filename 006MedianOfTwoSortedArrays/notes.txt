Problem:
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
**
Solution:
Iterate simultaneously through the sorted arrays and construct the merged sorted array.
If the length of the resulting array is an odd number, choose the middle element of the array as a median.
If the length of the resulting array is an even number, calculate the median from two middle elements of the array.
**
Complexity:
O(m+n) Time
O(m+n) Space
