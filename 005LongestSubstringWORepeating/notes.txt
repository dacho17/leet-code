Problem:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest
substring without repeating characters
**
Solution:
State(longestSubstring, startIndex, curIndex, mem).
While iterating through the string, check whether the current element has already been seen before.
If it has not been seen before, store the (element, index) entry in the dictionary.
If it has been seen before, check whether the index of the element falls into the current substring.
If it does, set the begining of substring to the first index after the index of the earlier seen element.
Set the current index as the last seen place of the element.

Complexity:
O(n) Time
O(n) Space
